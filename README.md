# ðŸŽ­ Mafia Project

**Mafia Project** is a terminal-based interactive bot game inspired by the classic party game "Mafia". This version is designed for single-device play with players interacting via the terminal. The game is entirely in English and does not support saving progress or online multiplayer.

## ðŸŽ® Game Overview

Mafia is a social deduction game where players are secretly assigned roles and must use logic, discussion, and deduction to determine who among them is part of the Mafia.

### Roles include:
- **Mafia** â€“ secretly eliminate others at night
- **Detective** â€“ investigate one player per night
- **Doctor** â€“ protect one player per night
- **Civilians** â€“ try to figure out who the Mafia are

The game alternates between **night** and **day** phases:
- At night: special roles act (Mafia, Doctor, Detective)
- During the day: players discuss and vote to eliminate a suspect

The game ends when either all Mafia are eliminated (civilians win), or the Mafia outnumber the other players (mafia win).
